# Concepts — placeholder

This directory is reserved for concept-level documentation: the vocabulary of Episteme explained
once, in one place, for readers who need to understand the project rather than use it.

The durable material that exists today lives elsewhere and should not be duplicated here:

- the pitch and core ideas — [`README.md`](../../README.md);
- the layering and the decision rule — [`architecture/overview.md`](../architecture/overview.md);
- why the architecture is the way it is — [`decisions/`](../decisions/);
- the Learn scene's vocabulary — [`packages/domain-learn`](../../packages/domain-learn/README.md).

## What belongs here

A page per distinction the project is built on, written once and linked to from code:

- **Information, Knowledge, Understanding.** The project exists to keep the third. `Document !=`
  `Understanding`, `Chat history != Understanding`, `Generated summary != Understanding`,
  `Knowledge graph != Learner graph`.
- **Draft, Thought, Reference.** The admission ladder, and why a raw AI transcript is never a thought.
- **Understanding vs. state.** What is being kept: what the user currently believes, why they believe
  it, what evidence supports it, what conflicts with it, how it changed, where it came from, what
  concepts it connects to, and which paths of inquiry led there.
- **Actor, authority, authorship.** Why "who believes this" and "who wrote this" are different
  questions.
- **Conflict as data.** Why a contradiction is preserved rather than resolved.
- **Fork and branch.** One understanding, several continuations.
- **Projection.** Why Learn, Forum and Research are views rather than products with their own stores.
- **Cognitive scaffold.** What an agent may and may not do, and why confirmation is structural.

## What does not belong here

Session journals, progress notes, and anything that will be stale next week. See the `Durable
Handoff` section of [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).
